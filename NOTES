chick is super lightweight - arduino scale, no tcp, deep sleep most of
the time.  chick is initially identified using its mac address. chick
must be preconfigured with the hen key.  can compute SHA256 and
HMAC-SHA256

hen is medium lightweight - raspberry pi scale.  has tcp, local
storage for files, sqlite3, apache with php, and python.  continuous
power but internet connectivity may be intermittent.  interacts with
coop via REST requests (config and data storage). identifies itself to
the coop with the hen key

coop is a server on the public internet - full linux


instead of giving chicks nodenums (and opening the possibility of
duplicates), we compute the message signature from the data
concatenated with the mac.  we also prepend a one byte hash of the mac
to help the hen pick the right mac(s) to check

nodemcu supports HMAC-SHA256 so we'll use that
