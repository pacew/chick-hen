start with blank psql data for coop and blank sqlite3 database for hen

* make user and set password in psql database
$ cd coop; ./mkuser

* create a hen in the master database
browse to coop, then hens -> add hen (choosing a name and key)

* configure a hen, storing config in sqlite3 database
$ cd hen; ./set-name-and-key

* configure a chick
$ cd chick; ./get-key
currently peeks in the sqlite3 database to get the hen key, then
stores in the chick nvram.  later, storing the hen_key in the chick
will be part of flashing the firmware

* now the chick and hen can communicate with authenticated messages
over the network

* get the chick mac's into the hen
$ cd hen; ./scan

* send the chick mac's to the coop
$ cd hen; ./report-chicks

* attach chick macs to chick records in coop
browse to coop -> setup; dangling chicks that have been reported can
be attached here

* define data collection chanlists
browse to coop -> chans; add chanlist

* assign chanlist to chicks
browse to coop -> hens -> chick -> chanlist -> change

* transfer chanlist configuration to hen
$ cd hen; ./get-chick-configs

* send chanlist config to chick's nvram
$ cd hen; ./put-chick-configs
